# Application and Registration for the Summer School #

The school is intended for PhD students, masters students, researchers, and industrial practitioners
who want to get a good understanding of proof assistants and their use for formalizing properties
in mathematics and computer science. Prior knowledge about proof assistants is not required, but
general problem solving skills, programming and math skills are helpful. Participants will also be given the
opportunity to give short presentations about their own research.

As the number of participants is limited, all prospective participants will have to apply and provide a description
of their research background and their motivation to attend the school. Based on this information,
approximately 60 participants will be chosen from all qualified applicants. Admitted participants will then be
provided a link for registration.

*Applications to the summer school are now closed, and notifications will be sent out later in June. If you missed the deadline, or have any questions about your application, please contact the organizers!*

## Preliminary deadlines ##

* Application opens: May 9, 2023
* Application deadline: June 9, 2023
* Notification: around June 19, 2023
* Regular registration deadline: August 1, 2023

## Registration fees for participants ##

The registration fees will be around 50EUR per participant. The fees
include the lectures, coffee breaks, and banquet.  They do **not** include
accommodation and travel expenses. Participants are kindly asked to
bring their own laptops (if possible) for the practical sessions.

Accommodation has to be booked independently. We have reserved a certain
number of rooms at nearby hotels in Regensburg, which
participants can book. Information about this will be provided after
registration.

We are also considering the possibility of opening the lectures (but
not exercises, etc.)  for remote attendance. Remote participants do
**not** have to apply to the summer school through the above form, and
there will be a separate registation form.
