# Application and Registration for the Summer School #

The school is intended for PhD students, masters students, researchers, and industrial practitioners
who want to get a good understanding of proof assistants and their use for formalizing properties
in mathematics and computer science. Prior knowledge about proof assistants is not required, but
general problem solving skills, programming and math skills are helpful. Participants will also be given the
opportunity to give short presentations about their own research.

As the number of participants is limited, all prospective participants will have to apply and provide a description
of their research background, and their motivation to attend the school. Based on this information,
approximately 60 participants will be chosen from all qualified applicants. Admitted participants will then be
provided a link for registration.

Accommodation has to be booked independently. We have reserved, however, blocks of rooms at nearby hotels in Regensburg,
which participants can book.
