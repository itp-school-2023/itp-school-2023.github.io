## Overview ##

Proof assistants are tools that enable the formal description and
rigorous analysis of complex systems. Proof assistants increasingly
find use in all areas in which mistakes are not an option; for instance,
in the design of hardware components, software programs, or
to produce machine-checked proofs of deep results in mathematics.

The first International Summer School on Interactions of Proof
Assistants and Mathematics presents state-of-the-art proof
assistants from different angles: theoretical foundations,
engineering aspects, applications in areas including mathematics
and computer science. The goal of the summer school is to introduce proof assistants to
students in both mathematics and computer science, while fostering
collaboration and exchange between those two communities.

## Venue ##

The summer school will take place in September 2023 in the town
centre of Regensburg in Bavaria, Germany. The Old Town of Regensburg is listed as
a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and considered the largest authentically preserved
medieval city in Germany. The summer school is organized by the University
of Regensburg.
