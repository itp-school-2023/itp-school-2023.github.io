# Random suggestions in random order for the weekend #

Public transport planners:
<a href="https://www.bahn.de/">bahn.de</a> (Deutsche Bahn),
<a href="https://www.rvv.de/">RVV</a> (local public transport)

* Contribute to/formalize math in your favourite proof assistant :)

* Visit Kloster Weltenburg:
  <a href="https://www.kloster-weltenburg.de/en/arr/">basic information on how to reach it</a>

* Visit Walhalla (the building, not the mythical place)
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walhalla_(memorial)">Wikipedia entry</a>

* Take a boat trip on the Danube

* Take a trip to Munich. Beware: The Oktoberfest is ongoing,
  with the obvious advantages and disadvantages (the Oktoberfest
  is a crowded affair and also public transport to/in Munich
  will be crowded).

* Go climbing. There are two indoor climbing options:
  <a href="https://www.boulderwelt-regensburg.de/">Boulderwelt</a> (bouldering);
  <a href="https://www.kletterzentrum-regensburg.de/">DAV Kletterzentrum</a> (rope-climbing; requires prior climbing experience)

* Take a closer look at the medieval city centre of Regensburg:
  Dom (cathedral), steinerne Br√ºcke (stone bridge), Rathaus (town hall),
  Schloss Thurn und Taxis, ...

* Visit a museum, e.g., Haus der bayerischen Geschichte

* Take a trip to Nuremberg

* Visit the (small but nice) botanical garden on the university campus

* Explore the river Regen by canoe

* Play Ultimate Frisbee on Fri afternoon (ask Matthias Uschold
  about the details):
